# True Random Bit Generator using CMOS Technology
The Random Bit Generator generates a random binary sequence when initialised. The circuit is implemented using CMOS technology and transmission gates. 
The circuit is simulated in DSHC, NGSpice and Microwind.<br>
All the circuit and layout files can be found in this repository. <br>
Python implementation of NIST Randomness Test suite used in this project is available at https://github.com/stevenang/randomness_testsuite.
