# True Random Bit Generator using CMOS Technology
The Random Bit Generator generates a random binary sequence when initialised. The circuit is implemented using CMOS technology and transmission gates. 
The circuit is simulated in DSHC, NGSpice and Microwind.
All the circuit and layout files can be found in this repository.
